## ðŸ‘‰[Live Deomo](https://living-cost-app-client-nikkizhou.vercel.app/)  

This is a simple app to compare living costs of different cities which was finished in one day.

Express is used for backend and React for front end. The main logic is to fetch data from external apis from backend then send them to front end.
Check the jpeg picture for the 'datastructure' for this app.

# Challenges:
Since the app render the last two elements from the state array, it was important to check if the length of the array.
It was somehow problematical to manipulate the data after I fetched it.


# What I have learnt:
1. When dealing with full-stack project, it's important to have controll for both backend and frontend in every stage.
2. When get stucked, try different ways to do more research about the problem.


# Future refactoring:
1. Would be great to be able to add the data fetched from api into database, then get the data from database in backend, then send to front end.
2. Would be great to add the feature where users can decide what kind of living costs to be shown on the page.
3. Would be great to get user's current location then show the living cost of that city as default.
